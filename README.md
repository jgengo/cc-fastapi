**cc-fastapi** is a minimal FastAPI project template for [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter), designed for quick prototyping and new service development. Built primarily for personal use, it eliminates repetitive boilerplate setup so I can focus on what matters.

If you actually enjoy using it, lovely 🩵
